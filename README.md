# Overview

My name is Bryson Williams I have always loved computers and have been programming for a few years now.
I've already made other programs in various languages and have them
posted to this github. As of now 9/17/22 I am aiming to become a Database admin or something else in that field.
Being able to pick up new programming languages is critical to starting to work in the computer science industry.

The code reads user input to select between two different games; tic tac toe and a Higher or lower game.
After completing a round of a game you are prompted if you want to play again or go back to the first menu.
You can play as many times as you want until you select to end the first menu where it then terminates the program.

I wrote this program to learn how to use java because it is very important to have a wide
breadth of knowledge of different programming languages and I haven't done anything in java until this.


# Development Environment

I used my laptop and home built desktop for the hardware and the intelliJ compiler for the software
to run the java program. Libraries used include; math, arraylist, objects, and scanner. math was used for
math related functions, arraylist was a data structure, and objects and scanner were used to read
user input.

# Useful Websites
* W3 schools(https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_getstarted.asp)
* geeksforgeeks(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/)

# Future Work
* add more games
* create a gui for the game select
* write the score to a separate file
